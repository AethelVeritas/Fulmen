**Time Spent: 6h 20m: **

Firstly, I did some research and decided on some constraints/goals:
1. Must be wireless.
2. Must use KS33 switches (Nuphy ones most likely), as they are cheaper than Choc switches.
3. Must be low-profile. I won't be able to make it very low-profile, not as much as I could have if I used Chocs, but I still want it to look and feel sleek. 
4. Must have at least 3 thumb keys, but not more than 5 columns. I have built a handwired 3x6 build, and while I did enjoy it, I want to try out 3 columns.
5. Hotswappable and reversible PCB. After how much time I wasted on mirroing components for my last trial design, I want something simpler now. The disadvantage would be of course that I would get less PCBs for the price, but oh well it is what it is.

Then, I started messing around with [Ergogen](https://ergogen.ceoloide.com/). I had built the layout for my previous handwired build using this tool, but I had forgetten a lot of things, so I took another look at [FlatFootFox's amazing guide](https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-introduction/), as well as the config.yaml of the [Avocado](https://github.com/auryn31/avocado) by Auryn. It took a couple of hours, but after messing around with it for some time I got a config I thought looked and felt pretty nice. So I printed out several plates and tested them  with some MX switches and keycaps I had lying around. One thing I really did struggle with was the outline: I tried to somehow combine two outlines (the switch cutouts as well as some cutouts that were 1mm bigger for the switch clips)into one .dxf, but I did not have any success. Eventually I just imported both into Onshape and positioned them there, which was tedious, but such is life. I probably won't make the final version in Ergogen: I find it easier in Onshape. The only thing I really want to use Ergogen for is positioning the switches.
